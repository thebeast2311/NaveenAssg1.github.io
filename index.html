<h2 style="text-align:left; font-size: 30px;color:seagreen">5 Five Facts About Mount Faber</h2>

	<ol style="font-size:20px;">
		<li><b>Mount Faber Was Named After Captain Charles Edward Faber</b></li>
			<ul>
			<li>In 1819, Sir Stamford Raffles established a trading port in Singapore and trade flourished, resulting in many ships arriving at the Singapore port. Captain Charles Edward Faber from Madras Engineers then built a new road to the summit of Telok Blangah Hill and installed a signal station and flagstaff for ships that sailed into the harbour. In recognition of his contribution, the government renamed Telok Blangah Hill to "Mount Faber" in July 1845.</li><br>
			</ul>
		<li><b>Mount Faber Was A Defence Fort for Colonial Singapore</b></li>
			<ul>
			<li>This tranquil hilltop park was once armed with guns to protect Singapore against attacks by enemy vessels, until 1885! From the hill's high vantage point, Mount Faber made for an ideal location to build a defence fort as the guns could easily pick out any enemy vessel from above.</li><br>
			</ul>
		<li><b>Mount Faber Was Home to Malay Royalty</b></li>
			<ul>
			<li>The foothill of Mount Faber was the royal settlement of Temenggong Abdul Rahman and his subjects since 1823. The royal burial ground and mausoleum of the Temenggong and his descendants on the hill slope remains until today and are under the care and ownership of the Sultan of Johore.</li><br>
			</ul>
		<li><b>Mount Faber Was Officially Opened by Former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew</b></li>
			<ul>
			<li>On 17 January 1965, Mount Faber Scenic Park was officially opened by Singapore's former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, the first park to be opened after Singapore's independence, to provide recreational spaces for Singaporeans, foreshadowing the vision of Singapore as a Garden City.</li><br>
			</ul>
		<li><b>Mount Faber is Home to the Singapore Cable Car</b></li>
			<ul>
			<li>Discover the picturesque spots along Henderson Waves (highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore connecting Mount Faber Peak to the neighbouring Telok Blangah Hill), the official Merlion sitting on the highest point on Faber Point, Poland's Bells of Happiness and vintage cable cars for photo worthy moments.
Not forgetting to enjoy some family dining or have a chill out at session at our restaurants!</li>
